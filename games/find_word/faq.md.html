                  **FIND WORD ALLL NITE FAQ**

How do I play?
: Go to https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/games/find_word/
  on a computer, phone, console, etc. for the ideal full-screen
  experience. You can also run quadplay
  in kiosk mode, but it will be scaled to the quadplay emulator
  window. The game is part of the quadplay open source distribution.

How do I earn XP and level up?
: Play in Global mode. Your XP locks in for the match when you hit the leaderboard
  screen after Gathering Results.

What if the game server is offline or overloaded?
: The server can't go down because there isn't a server. The app is
  fully distributed and peer-to-peer. This also means that the game
  is safe forever--anyone can copy it

Can I play in Global mode and earn XP if I am offline?
: Yes, if you have already loaded the page and don't reload. Your stats
  and XP are stored on your phone or computer. If you reload then obviously
  you won't be able to load the webpage for the game.
  
Can I play with people if I'm offline?
: Yes. Everyone in the world sees the same board at the same time even
  if they are offline, so it is fair and possible to discuss words and 
  matches even without internet access. For example, two friends in a log cabin off grid can even play next
  to each other on different phones and compare scores.

What's the deal with Moo and the other bots?
: Keep leveling up to find out.

Why isn't there an app?
: Dealing with app stores sucks time and energy, and their licensing rules make it 
  almost impossible for an open source game to exist. So I don't deal with that
  and just make the game free online.

Are the high scorers hacking?
: Probably not. It is possible but slightly difficult to hack the game. Some people
  are really good. But as you play more you will both personally learn some strategies
  by looking at other people's words *and* you will unlock new in-game abilities that
  grant score and XP bonuses.

Why doesn't it show definitions? That would be educational!
: Yes. I'm sorry we can't do that. (Good) dictionaries are copyrighted, so we can't include one directly for 
  free or in an open source game. The game engine doesn't link to external websites
  because that's a safety risk--you never know when someone will buy a dictionary
  website and change what is there. You definitely should take mystery words and 
  look them up on your own!

What about accessiblity?
: The game supports touch screen, mouse, keyboard, and various game
  controllers. It will automatically switch between those. Because
  of the nature of the game it is unfortunately impractical to add
  support for people with vision impairment. The game is designed
  to work well for different kinds of color vision and with hearing
  impairment.

What about other languages than English?
: English happens to work really well for word games because it has
  a ridiculous number of words (there are about 190k in this game's dictionary),
  a relatively small alphabet, and 
  an incredibly liberal spelling grammar due to borrowing words from
  many sources. It is 
  _possible_ to make word games in other languages. But, unfortunately,
  the gameplay is just not as interesting as in English.

Who made this game?
: Press the gear icon and select Credits to see the full credits. Briefly: the
  game is by [sʜᴍᴜᴇʟ](https://shmuel797.itch.io/). It is built on the [quadplay game engine](https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/) by Casual Effects.
  Harpy is the community manager for quadplay and the games in the quadplay distro.
