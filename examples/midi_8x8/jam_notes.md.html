                      **8x8 Touch Jam**

8x8 Touch Jam requirements:

- Must run in a web browser 
- Must use 8x8 RGB LED touch grid I/O
- Must support the Ableton, Novation, Akai, and LinnStrument 
  devices to the same level provided by midi_8x8.pyxl
 
See midi_8x8.pyxl for the API

Encouraged:

- Make gameplay primarily use the device touch input and output
  plus audio, with the computer screen used mainly for instructions
  instead of gameplay
- Support emulation on screen, for people without physical MIDI devices.
  device_visualize() and device_send_output() simplify emulation.
- Provide a single player mode
- Explore directions other than direct music synthesis

Discouraged:

- While you may use other APIs and tools than quadplay and device.pyxl.
  quadplay is the easy way to satisfy the requirements, and the goal 
  of this jam is supporting quadplay
- You may use additional I/O devices (gamepads, mouse, keyboard, other MIDI)
  so long as the game *also* requires an 8x8 RGB LED MIDI controller.
  Embracing the limitations and possibilities of the 8x8 grid is the
  best way to embrace the theme of the jam


This game demo is a sample showing how to set up the 
device, set device pad colors, read physical device input, 
use the multitouch screen emulator, play audio, and
convert from frame time to music beat time.
